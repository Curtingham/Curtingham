### Summary

Information Technology is my passion and I am a long-time enthusiast of open source software. Having mostly been on the receiving end of all the effort that goes into open source software in the past, I'm now looking to get much more involved in helping produce it. I'm always excited to learn new things and I am looking forward to making software development a more central part of my career and life.
